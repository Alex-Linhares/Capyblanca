# pyCapyblanca

A python implementation of Capyblanca

A first implementation will be done independently; and a second will be done using Abhijit Mahabal's framework, and documenting *the framework* for future developers (please see [FARGlexandria](https://github.com/Alex-Linhares/FARGlexandria) for more information).

The very next thing to do is to create a simple script that gets a textfile with a chessboard and displays it as a vector, svg file.  Then I need to recreate *all* the positions that should go on the FCCA2.0 chapter. I'm thinking about maintaining the lame 8-bit style that the original Capyblanca had in Delphi.  With that, the chapter writes itself. 

A second thing to do here is to look at those crazy map distortions, and ponder whether those morphed graphs would be interesting for looking into the world of chess.
